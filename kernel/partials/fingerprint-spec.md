## Fingerprints & Dedup

Every PR and issue you open embeds a stable fingerprint so the pack never
re-files a finding a human already saw — or rejected.

**Computing a fingerprint.** `sha256` of the formula components joined with
`:`, lowercase hex, truncated to 16 characters. Per-category formulas:

| Category | Formula components |
|---|---|
| bugs | `file : bug_class : normalized_snippet` |
| security | `file : vuln_class : sink_identifier` (the sink call — NEVER a payload) |
| docs | `doc_file : drift_class : normalized_claim` |
| test-gaps | `target_file : gap_class : symbol_or_invariant` |
| a11y | `file : rule_id : normalized_element_selector` |
| i18n | `file_or_locale : class : key_or_normalized_string` |
| perf | `file : perf_class : normalized_hotspot` |
| tech-debt | `primary_file : debt_class : refactor_class` |
| arch | `signal_class : path : suggested_title` |
| infra | `file : check_id : resource_identifier` |

Normalization: collapse every whitespace run to a single space; canonicalize
local identifier names (so renames don't change the fingerprint); strip the
contents of string literals. LINE NUMBERS ARE EXCLUDED — they rot. Identical
snippets within one file therefore dedup to a single finding: list every
occurrence in the evidence instead of filing twice.

**Dedup procedure (Phase 1, hard gate):** collect fingerprints from ALL states
— open and closed — of issues and PRs labeled with your `wolfe:<category>`
label (`gh issue list` / `gh pr list` with `--state all`, searching bodies for
`<!-- fingerprint:`). A candidate whose fingerprint already exists anywhere is
SKIPPED. A closed artifact labeled `wolfe:rejected` is a human saying "do not
re-file this" — honor it permanently.
