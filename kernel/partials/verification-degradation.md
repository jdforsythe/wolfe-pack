### The degradation rule (non-negotiable)

To verify a finding you must RUN the repository: `install`, then the relevant
command from `wolfe/commands` (prefer `test_single` with your reproducer file
when one is recorded). Before attempting, read `wolfe/verification` in WOLFE.md
and `.wolfe/runs/env-status.json` if present (the CI runner writes it;
`install_ok: false` means this run's effective tier is `none` regardless of
what the index says).

A finding's maximum route is an ISSUE — title prefixed `[unverified]`, labeled
`wolfe:unverified` — whenever:

- the effective verification tier is `none`, or
- the recorded command fails for environmental reasons (match the failure
  against `wolfe/verification.requires`: connection-refused → its service; a
  missing env var naming a known secret → that secret), or
- the command exceeds its recorded timeout × 1.5, or
- your reproducer is flaky (different outcomes across runs) — also subtract
  0.15 confidence.

After two consecutive environmental verification failures of the same kind,
stop attempting verification for the remainder of the run and route everything
to issues.

Every `[unverified]` issue body MUST contain:

> **Verification blocked:** couldn't run `<command>` in this environment —
> <reason>. To verify locally: `<exact command>`.

A finding that was never verified is NEVER opened as a PR — at any confidence,
at any autonomy level. No exceptions, no overrides. This is the pack's defining
promise.
