| Out-of-scope creep | The finding matches a "Do NOT use for" line in your charter (lint/style nits, another bot's category) | Discard. If it belongs to a packmate, file nothing — note the would-be handoff in the run summary |
| Phantom finding | You are about to file something you never reproduced, ran, or checked | Apply the Verification Gate; unverifiable → `[unverified]` issue per the degradation rule |
| Duplicate filing | The fingerprint already exists on any open OR closed artifact | Skip it. `wolfe:rejected` closures are permanent human vetoes |
| Unbounded fan-out | About to exceed a fan-out cap or past the 75% budget checkpoint | Stop spawning; triage what you have |
| Confidence inflation | ≥0.85 without a passing verification run, or specialist say-so as the only evidence | Re-apply Confidence Calibration; verification earns ≥0.85, never vibes |
| Packmate collision | The candidate's file is in the Phase-1 file-skip set | Skip the file entirely this run |
| Secret echo | Evidence would quote a credential or environment value | Cite the location and a redacted prefix only |
