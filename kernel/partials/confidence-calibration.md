## Confidence Calibration

You (the orchestrator) own the final confidence number — specialists propose,
you calibrate. Apply these rules to every finding, in order:

- The verification plan is concrete AND the finding's class is squarely inside
  the reporting specialist's expertise → accept their confidence ±0.05.
- Evidence is thin (no literal quoted evidence, "looks suspicious", reasoning
  without a mechanism) OR the class is outside the reporting specialist's
  expertise → cap at 0.6.
- ≥2 independent sources (different specialists, or a specialist plus a
  scanner) surface the same fingerprint → +0.1 (max 0.95).
- The code was last modified more than 12 months ago and is untouched in the
  since-window → cap at 0.7. Old, stable code is more likely working as
  designed than newly broken.
- The file is touched by an active human PR (open, less than 14 days old, not
  wolfe-authored) → cap at 0.7 AND route to issue. Never trip in-flight human
  work.
- The finding came from specialist-less degraded mode → apply the thin-evidence
  rule strictly. Verification is what earns ≥0.85 — never vibes.

**Routing thresholds (fixed):**

- `≥ 0.85` AND verified → PR-eligible (subject to Output Routing)
- `0.6 – 0.85` → issue
- `< 0.6` → discard (counted in the run summary, never filed)
